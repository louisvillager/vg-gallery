          The very first game of the storied franchise,
          <i>Final Fantasy I</i> is really little more than a glorified dungeon
          crawl. Light on story and graphics, but heavy on grinding, it only
          bears a superficial resemblance to the entries that followed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your party are the four Warriors of Light, heroes of prophecy who will
          return the elemental crystals to their rightful place and restore
          balance to the world. Why exactly your characters are the Warriors of
          Light and why every random villager seems to already know this is
          never explained.

          The first entry of the 16-bit SNES era, <i>Final Fantasy IV</i> was
          originally released in North America as <i>Final Fantasy II</i>, as
          the real II and III had not been released Stateside. In subsequent
          years, it has been rereleased on multiple platforms and even gotten a
          sequel in the form of <i>Final Fantasy IV: The After Years </i>.
          Featuring a large, rotating cast of playable characters, it also
          boasts an explorable world that includes a vast subterranean
          underworld and a small moon.

        <h2>Final Fantasy V</h2>
        <p class="released">SNES, 1992</p>
        <p>
          The last game of the main series to not see a timely release in North
          America, <i>Final Fantasy V</i> is one of only a few games in the
          series to use the Job System, wherein each playable character's role
          and abilities can change throughout the story as needed rather than
          being limited to a given archetype.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with other Final Fantasy games built around the Job System, the
          real strategy revolves around frequent tinkering and adjustments of
          each character's job to best respond to whatever challenge is next.
          The trade-off is that the characters have little depth and are rather
          generic, best exemplified when one character (Galuf) dies and is
          replaced by his granddaughter (Krile), who literally has the exact
          same stats as Galuf.

        <p>
          Considered by many to be the best entry in the series,
          <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> was originally released in North America as
          <i>Final Fantasy III</i>. Boasting the largest playable cast of the
          main series, many of the characters are given considerable depth well
          beyond anything the series had seen to that point.

        <p>
          The seeds of the grandeur and scope found in later games is present
          here. Your party participates in an opera. The final boss theme is an
          18-minute, multi-movement epic. The villain sets off a cataclysmic
          reshaping of the face of the world midway through the story. All in
          all, <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> has a beloved reputation that is well-

        <h2>Final Fantasy VII</h2>
        <p class="released">Playstation, 1997</p>
        <p>
          <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> marks a watershed moment in the history of
          Final Fantasy. It saw the departure of Square (now Square-Enix) from
          Nintendo to Sony due to Nintendo's use of cartridges (which have less
          data storage than discs) for its N64 console. It also abandoned the
          confusing renumbering system between Japanese and North American
          releases of the game (incidentally, itself causing confusion to gamers
          who last played "Final Fantasy III" and wondered what happened to
          IV-VI). Most obviously, it was also the first 3-D entry in the
          franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII saw a new flavor for the series with its cyberpunk aesthetic and
          its embrace of futurism, albeit a gritty, dirty future. It also took
          on a more "mature" feel with its various themes and settings (not to
          mention the salty dialogue by two of the main characters that Nintendo
          would never have allowed).
        </p>
        <p>
          With this game, the Final Fantasy series was truly vaulted into the
          mainstream, gaining heretofore untold popularity. Its heroes and
          villains became iconic, it spawned a smorgasbord of sequels, prequels,
          "mid-quels", and now even an extensive remake, across a variety of
          platforms and media. It remains to this day the most popular game in
          series history.

        <p class="released">Playstation, 1999</p>
        <p>
          Warning: I will not be charitable toward this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Square's first main series follow-up to VII, there was always a
          heavy burden of expectation on <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>. It is
          probably safe to say that it didn't live up to it. Considered a
          "divisive" game, its story focused on the romance between its two
          leads, Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartily. If those names alone don't
          make you roll your eyes, then maybe you were the target audience for
          this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't fault this game for trying something experimental with its
          mechanics. More main series Final Fantasies should be ambitious in
          that respect. I do fault them for settling on something that's very
          cumbersome and joyless, though. The Draw system, whereby spells were
          drawn from enemies in combat, slowed the game down considerably and
          made combat, already-repetitive on its own, feel like a downright
          chore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also pick on them&mdash;mercilessly&mdash;for hyping up a love
          story centered around a pouty jerk and a vapid bimbo. The two lead
          characters are thoroughly uninteresting and unlikeable, and their
          character arcs are obviously manufactured in an almost heavy-handed
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you like Final Fantasy games with a heavy dose of glossy, high-tech
          futurism, a resoundingly unenjoyable combat system, a severe lack of
          genuinely interesting characters, and all the 90's emo teen romance
          your heart could ask for, then sure, give this game a try. Otherwise,
          find a different one to play. Or read a book. Or write one! Start a
          garden. Pick up a new hobby. I'm serious, this game is
          <strong>NOT</strong> worth it!

        <h2>Final Fantasy IX</h2>
        <p class="released">Playstation, 2000</p>
        <p>
          The first game released after Square merged with Enix,
          <i>Final Fantasy IX</i> was, in many ways, the end of an era and a
          love letter to Final Fantasies I-VIII. It particularly drew heavily on
          references to the first three entries in the series, with a smattering
          of call-backs to later games.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX was a return to the series's high-fantasy roots, trading in the
          futuristic settings of VII and VIII for a vividly colorful
          swords-and-sorcery landscape that long-time fans were more familiar
          with. It was also flavored with more humor and light-heartedness than
          its two most recent predecessors. The cartoonish, sometimes playful
          character designs spoke to a more childlike embrace of the fun and
          whimsical aspects of Final Fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          While far from perfect, <i>Final Fantasy IX</i> is a fun and
          approachable entry in the series canon. Its characters can be
          surprisingly deep every now and then (Vivi the black mage is ranked by
          many fans as their favorite character all-time, and I would add it's
          not undeserved), and its themes of belonging are explored in a good
          variety of ways.
