          The very first game of the storied franchise,
          <i>Final Fantasy I</i> is really little more than a glorified dungeon
          crawl. Light on story and graphics, but heavy on grinding, it only
          bears a superficial resemblance to the entries that followed it.

          Your party are the four Warriors of Light, heroes of prophecy who will
          return the elemental crystals to their rightful place and restore
          balance to the world. Why exactly your characters are the Warriors of
          Light and why every random villager seems to already know this is
          never explained.

          The first entry of the 16-bit SNES era, <i>Final Fantasy IV</i> was
          originally released in North America as <i>Final Fantasy II</i>, as
          the real II and III had not been released Stateside. In subsequent

          Featuring a large, rotating cast of playable characters, it also
          boasts an explorable world that includes a vast subterranean
          underworld and a small moon.

        <h2>Final Fantasy V</h2>
        <p class="released">SNES, 1992</p>
        <p>
          The last game of the main series to not see a timely release in North
          America, <i>Final Fantasy V</i> is one of only a few games in the
          series to use the Job System, wherein each playable character's role
          and abilities can change throughout the story as needed rather than
          being limited to a given archetype.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with other Final Fantasy games built around the Job System, the
          real strategy revolves around frequent tinkering and adjustments of
          each character's job to best respond to whatever challenge is next.
          The trade-off is that the characters have little depth and are rather
          generic, best exemplified when one character (Galuf) dies and is
          replaced by his granddaughter (Krile), who literally has the exact
          same stats as Galuf.

          Considered by many to be the best entry in the series,
          <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> was originally released in North America as
          <i>Final Fantasy III</i>. Boasting the largest playable cast of the

          beyond anything the series had seen to that point.

          The seeds of the grandeur and scope found in later games is present
          here. Your party participates in an opera. The final boss theme is an
          18-minute, multi-movement epic. The villain sets off a cataclysmic
          reshaping of the face of the world midway through the story. All in
          all, <i>Final Fantasy VI</i> has a beloved reputation that is well-

        <h2>Final Fantasy VII</h2>
        <p class="released">Playstation, 1997</p>
        <p>
          <i>Final Fantasy VII</i> marks a watershed moment in the history of
          Final Fantasy. It saw the departure of Square (now Square-Enix) from
          Nintendo to Sony due to Nintendo's use of cartridges (which have less
          data storage than discs) for its N64 console. It also abandoned the
          confusing renumbering system between Japanese and North American
          releases of the game (incidentally, itself causing confusion to gamers
          who last played "Final Fantasy III" and wondered what happened to
          IV-VI). Most obviously, it was also the first 3-D entry in the
          franchise.
        </p>
        <p>
          VII saw a new flavor for the series with its cyberpunk aesthetic and
          its embrace of futurism, albeit a gritty, dirty future. It also took
          on a more "mature" feel with its various themes and settings (not to
          mention the salty dialogue by two of the main characters that Nintendo
          would never have allowed).
        </p>
        <p>
          With this game, the Final Fantasy series was truly vaulted into the
          mainstream, gaining heretofore untold popularity. Its heroes and
          villains became iconic, it spawned a smorgasbord of sequels, prequels,
          "mid-quels", and now even an extensive remake, across a variety of
          platforms and media. It remains to this day the most popular game in
          series history.

        <p class="released">Playstation, 1999</p>
        <p>
          Warning: I will not be charitable toward this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Square's first main series follow-up to VII, there was always a
          heavy burden of expectation on <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>. It is
          probably safe to say that it didn't live up to it. Considered a
          "divisive" game, its story focused on the romance between its two
          leads, Squall Leonhart and Rinoa Heartily. If those names alone don't
          make you roll your eyes, then maybe you were the target audience for
          this game.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't fault this game for trying something experimental with its
          mechanics. More main series Final Fantasies should be ambitious in
          that respect. I do fault them for settling on something that's very
          cumbersome and joyless, though. The Draw system, whereby spells were
          drawn from enemies in combat, slowed the game down considerably and
          made combat, already-repetitive on its own, feel like a downright
          chore.
        </p>
        <p>
          I will also pick on them&mdash;mercilessly&mdash;for hyping up a love
          story centered around a pouty jerk and a vapid bimbo. The two lead
          characters are thoroughly uninteresting and unlikeable, and their
          character arcs are obviously manufactured in an almost heavy-handed
          way.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you like Final Fantasy games with a heavy dose of glossy, high-tech
          futurism, a resoundingly unenjoyable combat system, a severe lack of
          genuinely interesting characters, and all the 90's emo teen romance
          your heart could ask for, then sure, give this game a try. Otherwise,
          find a different one to play. Or read a book. Or write one! Start a
          garden. Pick up a new hobby. I'm serious, this game is
          <strong>NOT</strong> worth it!

        <h2>Final Fantasy IX</h2>
        <p class="released">Playstation, 2000</p>
        <p>
          The first game released after Square merged with Enix,
          <i>Final Fantasy IX</i> was, in many ways, the end of an era and a
          love letter to Final Fantasies I-VIII. It particularly drew heavily on
          references to the first three entries in the series, with a smattering
          of call-backs to later games.
        </p>
        <p>
          IX was a return to the series's high-fantasy roots, trading in the
          futuristic settings of VII and VIII for a vividly colorful
          swords-and-sorcery landscape that long-time fans were more familiar
          with. It was also flavored with more humor and light-heartedness than
          its two most recent predecessors. The cartoonish, sometimes playful
          character designs spoke to a more childlike embrace of the fun and
          whimsical aspects of Final Fantasy.
        </p>
        <p>
          While far from perfect, <i>Final Fantasy IX</i> is a fun and
          approachable entry in the series canon. Its characters can be
          surprisingly deep every now and then (Vivi the black mage is ranked by
          many fans as their favorite character all-time, and I would add it's
          not undeserved), and its themes of belonging are explored in a good
          variety of ways.

        <h2>Final Fantasy X</h2>
        <p class="released">Playstation 2, 2001</p>
        <p>
          <i>Final Fantasy X</i> ushered in a new era of Final Fantasy games.
          Some of the changes were for the better (voice acting, improved
          graphics), some of it less so (this particular game's voice acting, a
          too-linear adventure).
        </p>
        <p>
          Where X excels is in some of its mechanics. With Square-Enix
          effectively committing full-time to the 3-person party size, the
          player is able to involve all 7 playable characters by swapping them
          out mid-battle. In other games, there were always a few characters
          that saw all the action, while the player likely kept some of the
          less-interesting ones on the sideline, resulting in scenarios where
          the story forced you to include one of your neglected party members
          who was now 20 levels below the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game also has what is hands-down the best system for summoning
          monsters of any entry in the series. Rather than treating summoned
          monsters as little more than particularly elaborate magic spells,
          "aeons" as they're called in this game are fully controllable, with a
          range of options on each turn that creates genuine tactical
          opportunities.

        <h2>Final Fantasy XII</h2>

        <p>
          I apparently like <i>Final Fantasy XII</i> more than most. I do not
          hide from this fact, but indeed embrace it and will defend it. I love
          its setting, its art style, its score, and in some ways its audacity.
          It's a treat for the eyes and the ears. It also feels like the love
          child of
          <a

          and

          It has the best combat of any Final Fantasy. Its fluid style, where
          there is no separate battle screen or music (save for particularly
          notable fights, like boss battles and the like), is very welcome in my
          book. The jarring transition into random encounters is gone, replaced
          by a seamless experience where enemies are every bit as part of the
          environment as the fantastic landscapes, the cool architecture, and
          the surprisingly good musical score by Hitoshi Sakimoto, taking over
          the duties from renowned series composer Nobuo Uematsu, who
          effectively retired after IX. I also like the Gambit system, which
          allows you to basically program your party members if you choose and
          avoid the need to micromanage every turn in every round of combat
          (even if some detractors say that "the game plays itself").
        </p>
        <p>
          There are knocks against this game, it's true. Its bad habit of not
          giving you any clues in-game about how to get the best equipment (and
          indeed, straight-up punishing you for being a thorough explorer by
          denying you the strongest weapon in the game if you opened certain
          ordinary treasure chests) is a bit of a jerk move. But its biggest sin
          was giving us Vaan, the "main character" who is flat, uninteresting,
          and clearly tacked on late in development, while Basch is relegated to
          "supporting character" despite having 10 times the character depth of
          Vaan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ask yourself this: who would you rather be front and center in this
          story? Vaan, who says he wants to be a sky pirate, then admits he
          doesn't really want to be one, but he's generally angry at the empire
          that invaded his homeland because his older brother died in battle? Or
          Basch, who fled his homeland to avoid war, then grew a spine and
          defended his adopted country, only to lose the war, then be imprisoned
          and (falsely) reported executed for high treason because his twin
          brother framed him for regicide? I ask you.

        <p class="released">Playstation 3, 2009</p>
        <p>
          If you thought I was unkind to <i>Final Fantasy VIII</i>, well...
          Buckle up.
        </p>
        <p>
          I. <strong>HATE.</strong> This game. I don't like its art style. I
          don't like most of its characters. (Hope and Snow are
          <i>the worst.</i>) I don't like most of the characters' <i>names</i>.
          (Hope and Snow are <i>THE WORST!</i>) I quickly found myself actively
          rooting for two of the playable characters to die. (Guess which two.)
        </p>
        <p>
          The music is repetitive. The world makes promises that it will be
          interesting, then quickly abandons that promise to spend time finding
          more ways to show off its graphics. The character names are crap. They
          sound like the writers were just throwing out sounds the human mouth
          can make and seeing how many they could come up with before lunch.
          The combat is restrictive, giving you no direct control over two of
          the three party members.
        </p>
        <p>
          This game actively steals your joy. It truly does. I got midway
          through the game and never picked it back up. I thought a few times
          that I ought to, then one day realized, "I just don't like this game
          and nobody says I have to play it." So I didn't. Ever again.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'll tell you what truly boils my blood about this game, though. It
          failed on its promise to deliver an interesting story, but it did
          implicitly promise one other thing, something it has fulfilled in
          spades: it told me that Final Fantasy would never be good again. The
          series that accompanied me through my childhood had given up making
          fun games and just wanted to be moody anime instead. Its characters
          were unlikeable, its settings uninteresting, and its future trajectory
          was just more of the same. Somehow I knew it. I could feel it in my
          bones. And from what I know about XIII's sequels and
          <i>Final Fantasy XV</i>, this sobering truth emerges: I was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Final Fantasy XIII</i> killed the Final Fantasy series for me. For
          that, I can never forgive it.
